# Exercism
Repository used to collect [Exercism](https://exercism.org) solutions.
The solution are automatically synched using a native functionality of Exercism. (pretty useful!)

## What's Exercism?
[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a free, community-powered platform for learning programming through coding exercises and a mentor network.
You can find more information about them [here](https://exercism.org/about)

## Repository Structure
Exercism by default will collect exercises solutions under the solutions folder. 
Then it will group by programming language or technology and if the solution has more than 1 iteration, it will group for the iteration number as well.
Something like this:
```bash
exercism/
└── solutions/
    └── <language>/
        └── <problem>/
            └── <iteration number>/
                └── <code files>
```
